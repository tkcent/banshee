Banshee
=======

Banshee is a PHP website framework, which aims at being secure, fast and easy
to use. It has a Model-View-Controller architecture (XSLT for the views).
Although it was designed to use MySQL as the database, other database
applications can be used as well with only little effort.

Ready to use modules like a forum, photo album, weblog, poll and a guestbook
will save web developers a lot of work when creating a new website. Easy to use
libraries for e-mail, pagination, HTTP requests, database management, images,
cryptography and many more are also included.

Most software that can be used to create a website is either a framework or a
Content Management System (CMS). The disadvantage of a framework is that it
requires quite some time and work to build a website, because it has no
ready-to-use interface. The disadvantage of a CMS is that it requires quite
some knowledge about the CMS (and hacking) to extend its functionality. Banshee
has none of these disadvantages as it is more of a hybrid, a framework with CMS
functionality and ready-to-use modules. That makes Banshee actually a, what we
call, Content Management Framework (CMF). The reason for still describing it as
a framework is because more people are familiar with that term than with CMF.
